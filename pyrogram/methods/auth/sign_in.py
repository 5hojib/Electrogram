        Parameters:
            phone_number (``str``):
                Phone number in international format (includes the country prefix).

            phone_code_hash (``str``):

            phone_code (``str``):
                The valid confirmation code you received (either as Telegram message or as SMS in your phone number).

            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.User` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.TermsOfService` | bool: On success, in case the
