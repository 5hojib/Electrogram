        This is the equivalent of clicking an inline button containing callback data.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                You can also use user profile/chat public link in form of *t.me/<username>* (str).

            message_id (``int``):
                The message id the inline keyboard is attached on.

            callback_data (``str`` | ``bytes``):
                Callback data associated with the inline button you want to get the answer from.

            password (``str``, *optional*):
                When clicking certain buttons (such as BotFather's confirmation button to transfer ownership), if your account has 2FA enabled, you need to provide your account's password.
                The 2-step verification password for the current user. Only applicable, if the :obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardButton` contains ``callback_data_with_password``.

            timeout (``int``, *optional*):
                Timeout in seconds.

        Returns:
            The answer containing info useful for clients to display a notification at the top of the chat screen
            or as an alert.

        Raises:
            TimeoutError: In case the bot fails to answer within 10 seconds.
            ValueError: In case of invalid arguments.
            RPCError: In case of Telegram RPC error.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                await app.request_callback_answer(chat_id, message_id, "callback_data")
        """

        # Telegram only wants bytes, but we are allowed to pass strings too.
        data = bytes(callback_data, "utf-8") if isinstance(callback_data, str) else callback_data
