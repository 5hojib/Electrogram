        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target user/channel.
                For your personal story you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                You can also use user profile/channel public link in form of *t.me/<username>* (str).

            story_ids (``int`` | Iterable of ``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a single story identifier or an iterable of story ids (as integers) to get the content of the
                story themselves.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Story` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Story`: In case *story_ids* was not
            a list, a single story is returned, otherwise a list of stories is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get one story
                await app.get_stories(chat_id, 12345)

                # Get more than one story (list of stories)
                await app.get_stories(chat_id, [12345, 12346])

        Raises:
            ValueError: In case of invalid arguments.
