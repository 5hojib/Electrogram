Storage Engines
===============

Every time you login to Telegram, some personal piece of data are created and held by both parties (the client, Electrogram
and the server, Telegram). This session data is uniquely bound to your own account, indefinitely (until you logout or
decide to manually terminate it) and is used to authorize a client to execute API calls on behalf of your identity.

Persisting Sessions
-------------------

In order to make a client reconnect successfully between restarts, that is, without having to start a new
authorization process from scratch each time, Electrogram needs to store the generated session data somewhere.

Different Storage Engines
-------------------------

Electrogram offers two different types of storage engines: a **File Storage** and a **Memory Storage**.
These engines are well integrated in the framework and require a minimal effort to set up. Here's how they work:

File Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the most common storage engine. It is implemented by using **SQLite**, which will store the session details.
The database will be saved to disk as a single portable file and is designed to efficiently store and retrieve
data whenever they are needed.

To use this type of engine, simply pass any name of your choice to the ``name`` parameter of the
:obj:`~pyrogram.Client` constructor, as usual:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    async with Client("my_account") as app:
        print(await app.get_me())

Once you successfully log in (either with a user or a bot identity), a session file will be created and saved to disk as
``my_account.session``. Any subsequent client restart will make Electrogram search for a file named that way and the
session database will be automatically loaded.

Memory Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you don't want to have any session file saved to disk, you can use an in-memory storage by passing True to the
``in_memory`` parameter of the :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` constructor:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    async with Client("my_account", in_memory=True) as app:
        print(await app.get_me())

This storage engine is still backed by SQLite, but the database exists purely in memory. This means that, once you stop
a client, the entire database is discarded and the session details used for logging in again will be lost forever.

Mongodb Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you want to have persistent session but you don't have persistent storage you can use mongodb storage by passing
mongodb config as ``dict`` to the ``mongodb`` parameter of the :obj:`~pyrogram.Client` constructor:

Using async_pymongo (Recommended for python3.9+):

.. code-block:: python

    from async_pymongo import AsyncClient
    from pyrogram import Client

    conn = AsyncClient("mongodb://...")

    async with Client("my_account", mongodb=dict(connection=conn, remove_peers=False)) as app:
        print(await app.get_me())


Using motor:

.. code-block:: python

    from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
    from pyrogram import Client

    conn = AsyncIOMotorClient("mongodb://...")

    async with Client("my_account", mongodb=dict(connection=conn, remove_peers=False)) as app:
        print(await app.get_me())

This storage engine is backed by MongoDB, a session will be created and saved to mongodb database. Any subsequent client
restart will make Electrogram search for a database named that way and the session database will be automatically loaded.

Session Strings
---------------

In case you want to use an in-memory storage, but also want to keep access to the session you created, call
:meth:`~pyrogram.Client.export_session_string` anytime before stopping the client...

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    async with Client("my_account", in_memory=True) as app:
        print(await app.export_session_string())

...and save the resulting string. You can use this string by passing it as Client argument the next time you want to
login using the same session; the storage used will still be in-memory:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    session_string = "...ZnUIFD8jsjXTb8g_vpxx48k1zkov9sapD-tzjz-S4WZv70M..."

    async with Client("my_account", session_string=session_string) as app:
        print(await app.get_me())

Session strings are useful when you want to run authorized Electrogram clients on platforms where their ephemeral
filesystems makes it harder for a file-based storage engine to properly work as intended.
